I have created the submission link. You need to check backprop against analytics gradient calculation for a two layer (two nodes in the input, output, and hidden layers) take a single input [1,1]

Now the other assignments were:
->Calculation of number of multiplications for normal convolution vs depthwise separable convolution....Input 12 x 12 x 3, want output 8 x 8 x 256
->The loss function if the relation between the output and input variables can be described through a Poisson distribution.
